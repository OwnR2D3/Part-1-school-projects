Bus Tracker 

About
    This exercise is a map of MIT and when you run the program, it will track the bus location between MIT and Harvard. 

Running the Program
    1)  Open the "index.html" into any web browser
    2)  Click "Show stops between MIT and Harvard" to see the movement of the bus.

Future Ideas
    1)  Expand to a local map of Nashville, TN.
    2)  See live bus movements
    3)  Add variable difference in bus route (i.e. later or earlier than expecteds)
